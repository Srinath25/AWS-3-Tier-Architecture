ðŸ’» Architecting a Scalable and Resilient Three-Tier Application on AWS.

I recently completed a project where I designed and implemented a robust three-tier architecture on AWS for a React.js frontend, Node.js backend, and Aurora MySQL database.

Key components of the architecture:
Public-facing Application Load Balancer: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple web tier EC2 instances.
Web Tier (Nginx): Serves static React.js content and proxies API requests to the application tier.
Application Tier (Node.js): Handles business logic, interacts with the Aurora MySQL database, and communicates with the web tier.
Internal Application Load Balancer: Distributes traffic across multiple application tier instances.
Aurora MySQL Database: Stores and manages application data with high availability and durability.

To ensure high availability and scalability:
Load Balancing: Implemented at both web and application tiers using Application Load Balancers.
Health Checks: Regularly monitor the health of EC2 instances and automatically remove unhealthy instances from the load balancer.
Autoscaling Groups: Dynamically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on load to maintain optimal performance.
By carefully architecting and implementing this solution, we achieved a highly available, scalable, and performant application capable of handling increased traffic and data volumes.
